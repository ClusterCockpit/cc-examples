# Example configurations for ClusterCockpit installations

This is a collection of overall ClusterCockpit configurations that are used in
production.

We are aware that the configuration of ClusterOCkcpit is currently tedious
involving to edit many different files with partly redundant information.
Hopefully we can provide something simpler in the future.

Please note that the subcluster sections in the job archive cluster config files
can (and should) be generated with [this](https://github.com/ClusterCockpit/cc-backend/blob/master/configs/generate-subcluster.pl) provided perl skript.
